## 📌 Project Overview
This project explores the "Empathy Process Flow," a key aspect of Design Thinking, to analyze user feedback from feedback.csv, understand user pain points, and improve product usability. This project is related to L&T's Critical Thinking, Design Thinking, Leadership, and Teamwork initiative.

## 🎯 Objectives
- ✅ Understand user pain points through sentiment analysis of feedback.csv.
- ✅ Categorize feedback into Positive, Neutral, and Negative sentiments.
- ✅ Provide insights for improving user experience and creating user-centric solutions.
- ✅ Apply the Empathy Process to understand what users SAY, THINK, FEEL, and DO based on feedback.csv.

## 📂 Project Structure
- 📄 Empathy_Process_Flow.pdf - Final report detailing the research, findings, and empathy map based on feedback.csv.
- 📊 sentiment_analysis.ipynb - Jupyter Notebook for analyzing feedback from feedback.csv and visualizing sentiment.

## 🧠 Empathy Map
### 🗣️ Says:
- "I love the new features!"
- "The app is too slow."
- "The customer support is terrible."

### 🤔 Thinks:
- "This product is great."
- "I'm frustrated with the login process."
- "They need to update the design."

### 😃 Feels:
- Happy with the quality.
- Disappointed with the performance.
- Confused by the interface.

### 👤 Does:
- Uses the app regularly.
- Contacts customer support.
- Looks for alternative products.

## 🛠️ How to Use
### 1️⃣ Install Required Libraries
Run the following command in the terminal:

pip install pandas nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn

Ensure you have Python installed. If not, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### 2️⃣ Run the Jupyter Notebook
Open `sentiment_analysis.ipynb` using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook. Execute the cells to load data from `feedback.csv`, perform sentiment analysis, and visualize the results.

### 3️⃣ Interpret the Output
The script categorizes feedback as "Positive," "Neutral," or "Negative." Visualize user sentiment using the generated graphs. Refer to `Empathy_Process_Flow.pdf` for a detailed analysis of the results.

### 4️⃣ Open `Empathy_Process_Flow.pdf`
Use a PDF viewer (Adobe Reader, Google Chrome, etc.) to view the document.

## 📌 Conclusion
By applying the Empathy Process Flow using data from `feedback.csv`, we can design better solutions by understanding user emotions and feedback, ensuring a more user-friendly experience. This process helps in:
- Understanding user pain points.
- Enhancing product usability.
- Creating user-centric solutions.
- Improving customer satisfaction.
