# Empathy Process Flow (Task 11) - A Design Thinking Approach

## Project Overview

This project explores the "Empathy Process Flow," a key aspect of Design Thinking, to analyze user feedback from 'feedback.csv', understand user pain points, and improve product usability. This project is part of L&T's Critical Thinking, Design Thinking, Leadership, and Teamwork initiative.

## Objectives

* Understand user pain points through sentiment analysis of 'feedback.csv'.
* Categorize feedback from 'feedback.csv' into Positive, Neutral, and Negative.
* Provide insights for improving user experience and creating user-centric solutions.
* Apply the empathy process to understand users' "Says, Thinks, Feels, and Does" based on 'feedback.csv'.

## Project Structure

* `Empathy_Process_Flow.pdf`: Final report detailing the research, findings, and empathy map based on 'feedback.csv'.
* `sentiment_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing feedback from 'feedback.csv' and visualizing sentiment.
* `feedback.csv`: Sample dataset containing user feedback.

## Empathy Map

* **Says:**
    * "I love the new features!"
    * "The app is too slow."
    * "The customer support is terrible."
* **Thinks:**
    * "This product is great."
    * "I'm frustrated with the login process."
    * "They need to update the design."
* **Feels:**
    * Happy with the quality.
    * Disappointed with the performance.
    * Confused by the interface.
* **Does:**
    * Uses the app regularly.
    * Contacts customer support.
    * Looks for alternative products.

## How to Use

1.  **Install Required Libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install pandas nltk scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
    ```
    * Ensure you have Python installed. If not, download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
    * Open your terminal or command prompt and run the above command to install the necessary libraries.
2.  **Run the Jupyter Notebook (`sentiment_analysis.ipynb`):**
    * Open the Jupyter Notebook using Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook.
    * Execute the cells in the notebook to load the data from 'feedback.csv', perform sentiment analysis, and visualize the results.
3.  **Interpret the Output:**
    * The script categorizes feedback as "Positive," "Neutral," or "Negative."
    * Visualize user sentiment using the generated graphs.
    * Refer to the `Empathy_Process_Flow.pdf` for a detailed analysis of the results.
4.  **Open Empathy_Process_Flow.pdf:**
    * Use a pdf viewer to open and view the document.
5.  **Open feedback.csv:**
    * Use a spreadsheet program such as Excel or Google Sheets, or a text editor to view the file.

## Conclusion

By applying the "Empathy Process Flow," using data from 'feedback.csv', we can design better solutions by understanding user emotions and feedback, ensuring a more user-friendly experience. This process helps in:

* Understanding user pain points.
* Enhancing product usability.
* Creating user-centric solutions.
* Improving customer satisfaction.
